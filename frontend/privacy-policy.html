                            <li>In order for Show it with Mackie Services to operate the Show it with Mackie Network and to perform its obligations under the Contract, it may be necessary for Show it with Mackie Services: (i) to process, including but not limited to collect, use, revise, store and billing, utilization, traffic and other data, and to have access to and otherwise process personal data which Show it with Mackie Services (or its subcontractors) may use along with other User data, in accordance with applicable law and regulation to provide the Service, and (ii) to transfer, process and store data outside Middle East including the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United States, in accordance with applicable law and regulation, and User hereby agrees to such process and transfer).

The User represents and warrants that throughout the term of the Contract it has or will have the full right to access the material/content transmitted by the means of the Service(s) and is or will be entitled to receive the material/content distributed by Show it with Mackie Services by the means of the Service(s) (and shall procure the same for any of its authorized end user) and that there is no outstanding agreement, judgment or any threatened or pending litigation or proceedings against it that would have a material adverse effect on the performance of its obligations under this Contract.</li>
                            <li>Given the nature of the Service(s), the User is solely responsible and liable for the content of the signal transmitted by the means of the Service(s), for implementing authentication measures and maintaining the security (by implementing appropriate monitoring, defensive or protective tools or measures) of the User's account login information, passwords and any other information used to gain access to the Service(s), for backing up all User content and User data and for any encryption of the User content or User data on or in connection with the Service(s), for any damages,  interferences and/or other malfunctions, howsoever caused to the Show it with Mackie Network or any part thereof or to any third party's network. Accordingly the User shall indemnify and hold Show it with Mackie Services and third parties harmless against any and/or all claims, costs, damages, expenses (including attorney's fees) arising out of or relating to the User's use of any/all parts of Show it with Mackie Network, and/or arising out of a breach by the User (and/or its end users) of any of its undertakings, representations, warranties, guarantees or obligations under the Contract or when transmitting on the Show it with Mackie Network.</li>

In the event no written notification is addressed to Show it with Mackie Services within the aforementioned deadline, the Service(s) shall be deemed accepted and the User shall not be entitled to make any claim, objection or raise any right to a credit. The Service Level must be in the Contract. To be eligible for a credit under a Service Level, the User must be in good standing with no delinquent invoices, in addition to any other express Service Level requirements.

Unless stated otherwise in the Service Level, credits must be requested in writing within 30 (thirty) calendar days after the end of the month in which the failure occurred. Total monthly credits will never exceed the charges for the affected Service(s) for that month. For the avoidance of doubt, failure to meet the Service Level for reasons attributable (whether directly or indirectly) to a Force Majeure Event shall not entitle the User to enforce the Service Level.</li>
